I like a red *
Driving * is ok
* is like eating moons
Settling on * 
The * snow settles down
* to the world
Understand the * 
I watch the * clouds form
* at the sky
I am A *
The many * show my
* out at sea.
Porkchops are like *
Tasting like * goodness
* in my gut
A haiku about a *.
A random * haiku.
*: A gerund.
Talking on the *
You make a * joke.
*, no one laughs
Green the color of * .
The coins are * to make.
* your life fast.
The cup sitting *
as the tea *leaves sway
* from the warm mug 
The growing cold *
The plants of the day *
* the boys cry 
I really hate *
Even when they are *
* is stupid
The growing cold *
The plants of the day *
* when it is
A dog barks at  *
While chasing the largest *
*  to go out
Beautiful *
flotation * mango
* fisherman
For all of the *
Computers keep * on
* not to crash
Having a strange *,
The * donkey did have
* a problem.
Flowers sit in * 
Shades of the * tree near
* in sunset
When begins the *
And the * Crocus blooms
* any thing
Anxious like a *
Searching for the * blade
* away fast
When you start a *
Sounds of a * beast roar
* loud above
I do not like*
Driving * is ok
* is like eating moons.
